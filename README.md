# What it does
Set pics for the little monitors next to the buttons. 
This repository needs https://github.com/sanette/intuos4-oled to run, so make sure to have this installed and ready to run.

# How to use
Install https://github.com/sanette/intuos4-oled
Execute setwacompics.sh to set pics, feel free to change them up - this setup is just what works for me.

# Also helpful
- https://github.com/sanette/intuos4-oled for intuos4oled.py which allows setting up pics
- kcmshell5 for setting the button key binds
- kcm_wacomtablet for a nice gui to set up the buttons, stylus etc 
- also useful: alias wacom='kcmshell5 kcm_wacomtablet'
